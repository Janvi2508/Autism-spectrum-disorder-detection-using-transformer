# Autism-spectrum-disorder-detection-using-transformer

# Dataset Preparation: 
Since no direct image-based ASD dataset was available, extracted relevant features from Kaggle autism datasets (CSV files). Converted numerical data into bar graph visualizations to create an image-based dataset suitable for computer vision models.

# Model Implementation: Applied a Vision Transformer (ViT-B16) for classification of generated ASD images on the created dataset.

# Performance Achieved:
 1. Accuracy: 0.9929
 2. Precision: 0.9744
 3. Recall: 1.0000
 4. F1 Score: 0.9870
 5. Cohenâ€™s Kappa: 0.9821

# Contribution:
Demonstrated the feasibility of transforming tabular ASD datasets into image-based representations for applying state-of-the-art vision models.
